# Backrooms-net route types and levels

# Control Route - Used internally to consistently talk with other nodes to discuss security, opening routes, ect...
# Test Route - Used internally to test the viability of a route.
# Unencrypted - Can be used if the client on the other end handles it's own encryption/doesn't need it.
#   (Levels) None, Hops(1-12)
# Encrypted - Encrypted with each Node's RSA key. (Onion)
#   (Levels) No-Onion, Hops(1)
#            Low, Hops(2-3), 
#            Medium, Hops(4-5),
#            High, Hops(6-12)
# Highway - If there are many connections going out to one client on the network, a highway (Still a route) can be created.
#           By using a highway, which is a single connection, we can bunch up users together to blend their traffic.
#           This hardens against timing attacks.
#
#           When to use? - When we have more than 5 clients going to the same place.
#           Completely optional. It is up to the client to decide if they want to join the highway.
#           A highway will use the most common level 

#
# On the network
#
#               (No Identification)
# Client A (UUID4) --- HOPS --- Client B (UUID4)

# Backrooms message types and explations
#
# 1. Challenge - We have received the public key of the connecting party
# We will give them a random number to decrypt (16 Bytes)
#
# 2. Challenge response - We just send the number back using the originators public key
#
# 3. Ask For Friends - Simply ask for friends
#
# 4. Friend announce - One friend per message
#
# 5. Connection Test - Blank secure message to test latency
#
# 6. Message from client
